package profile

import "errors"

// Profile is the per-tool descriptor that a launcher (databricks-claude,
// databricks-codex, databricks-opencode) fills in with its own implementations
// of the three seams below. Because each launcher is its own `package main` and
// cannot be imported, the interfaces live here in internal/profile and the
// concrete implementations live in the launcher's own package (see
// cmd/databricks-claude/profile_claude.go for the claude wiring).
//
// There is deliberately NO EnvVars field: the env block written into
// settings.json is assembled at the call site (main.go) and handed to
// SettingsPatcher.Patch via PatchRequest.Env. Baking a static env map into the
// Profile would lose the per-run OTEL / model-routing values computed at launch.
type Profile struct {
	// Name is the stable identifier for the tool (e.g. "databricks-claude").
	Name string
	// ChildBinary is the downstream binary the wrapper launches (e.g. "claude").
	ChildBinary string
	// ConfigPath resolves the tool's settings file path (e.g.
	// ~/.claude/settings.json). Returns an error when the home dir is
	// unresolvable.
	ConfigPath func() (string, error)
	// GatewayPath is the AI Gateway URL suffix appended to the Databricks host
	// (e.g. "/ai-gateway/anthropic"). Each launcher sets it from its own
	// gatewayPath const, so the const is the single source of truth (#218).
	//
	// API-shape-only: nothing outside tests reads this field. The launch paths
	// call their own ConstructGatewayURL (which joins via dbxauth.GatewayURL)
	// rather than reading it here — some of those call sites have no Profile to
	// read it from.
	//
	// SINGLE-VALUED — do not "fix" this by making it the sole source. opencode
	// has two upstreams (Anthropic on the catch-all and Gemini Native on
	// /v1beta); only the Anthropic path is representable here, so wiring this
	// field as authoritative would silently drop opencode's Gemini route. If a
	// real consumer ever needs the gateway path, model the multi-upstream case
	// first.
